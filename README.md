## Model Purpose and General Information
PROFIN enables discounted cash flow analysis for energy projects.

### <u>INPUT</u>
- Energy input and output
- Financial metrics: CAPEX and OPEX, depreciation period, price developments, 
equity ratio, country risk, interest on debt, subsidies, tax rate

### <u>DCF analysis</u>
Additional features:

- Monte-Carlo simulation of specific project risks
- Simulation of funding demand (H2Global, CfD, etc.) to achieve positive net present value
- API link to  [yahoo-finance](https://finance.yahoo.com) for latest financial data

### <u>OUTPUT</u>
- Weighted Average Cost of Capital (**WACC**)
- Net Present Value (**NPV**)
- Internal Rate of Return (**IRR**)
- Value-at-Risk (**VaR**)
- Levelized Cost of Energy (**LCOE**)
- **Sharpe-ratio** (risk measure)
- **Cashflow** visualization
- **Funding demand** for NPV=0
